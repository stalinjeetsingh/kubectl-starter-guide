##Now to link pods whose ip keep changing, we need to access them trough a stable/static ip
##for that we use a service. below is an example to creata service.
## important point is to map the same tier:webs as mention in pods yml file.
##this will link the serive-->pods
##in my pods yml file tier: wbes and in my service yml file tier: webs which is enough to link them

kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    tier: webs
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    
    ***************************************
    ##but service only map 1 service to all the diffrent pods but they are not accessible from outside.
    ##for that make service as loadbalancer. It will gave us a expertal ip.
    ##just put type: LoadBalancer in above file as shown below:
    
    
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    tier: webs
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    
    Commands:
    kubectl create -f svc.yml
    kubectl get svc
    kubectl describe svc webs2 (service name you get from get svc command)
    kubectl delete svc webs2
    watch kubectl get pods 
    
    kubectl describe svc webs2 will display internal and exteral ip. You can test external ip in the browser
