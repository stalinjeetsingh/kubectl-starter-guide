to exceute a command
kubectl exec pod-name command
kubectl exec webs pwd
kubectl exec webs  -c container1 ls
kubectl exec webs  -c container2 pwd

by default there are three namespace in kubernetes
namespace define a close boundries for all the pods/containers inside it.

Default namespace (in Google cloud kubernetes):
1.default
2.kube-public
3.kube-system

if we dont specific anything the newly creatly pods will it in delaut namespace

## how to creata namespace
kubectl create ns testnamespace

to link it to any pods, specifi namespace:testnamespace under metadata field.

now if you create a pod with above config and run kubectl get pods, you will get nothing.
they have moved to testnamespace from default namespace

instead run kubectl get pods -n testnamespace
you will find all the pods defined inside yml file with filed namespace:testnamespace

*******************************
communication:

you get a single ip for your pod which is running two or more container.Now from container -t0- container we can use localhost to 
connect to one another to use any service
kubectl exec sample -c centos(cont1) -- ping localhost(cont2)
# sample=pod
#centos(1st container)
#centos2(2nd conatiner)


1.communication between two container is very straight forward as there there same netwrok so no issue in communication
conatiner -to - container
kubectl exec conainter1 -c conatiner2 --ping localhost

2. pod -to - pod 
we can do that with ip but ip keeps changing sometime.With name it will not work but with IP we can.

3. Service to Service
we cannot creat service directly on pod. We need replication sets.
Now from any pod/replicaset on 1st server can access stuff from server 2 we just need to define the service related with server2
e.g kubectl exec web2-444cq (pod/replica on 1 server) -- curl -s my-service22( service linked with server 2)

we can acess different items via services from one pod to another if we use services
but they are in same namespace but what if there are different namespaces

we cannot communicate from one namespace. for that we will provide fully qualified doamin name than we can commnication between different namespace
nslookup will gave you the fqdn


so namespace -to - namespace will be via fqdn
# use nslookup to find the fqdn
