how to create pods

#sample.yml (file name)

apiversiom:v1
kind:pod
metadata:
  name:mypod
spec:
  containers:
     name:
     image:
     cmd:["ls" "pwd"]

***************************

comand to create pods:
kubectl create 0f sample.yml

# to check the pods
kubectl get pods

# to check the logs
 kubectl logs sample

***************************
if we want something to run continously than we create pod
if we want something to run short time than we create service/job

if you specific a command/service to run e.g kind:pod than kubernete will try to run command again and again even if it exectuted.
so we can define it as kind:service


apiversiom:batch/v1
kind:job
metadata:
  name:mypod
spec:
 templete"
   spec:
     containers:
        name:
        image:
        cmd:["ls" "pwd"]
   restartpolicy: never

# to check the job
kubectl get job
