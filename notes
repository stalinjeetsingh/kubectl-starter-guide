kubernetes:

Kubectl is a client/control for our kubernetes 

its quite senstive to uppercase/lower case commands so be extra careful.For e.g
kind: Job (J capital) or restartPolicy: Never (P and N capital)


#also create a group 
sudo groupadd docker
#add the user to it
sudo usermod -a -G myusername docker

# if you running kubernetes on google cloud vm, you dont need master.you just need nodes
also run gcloud auth login (to access kubernetes on gcloud)
and run "gcloud container clusters get-credentials standard-cluster-1 --zone us-central1-a --project devops1-218400"
here devops1-218400 is my project name.replace it with your project name

how to create pods

#sample.yml (file name)

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sample 
spec:
  containers:
    - name: centos 
      image: centos 
      
 ## in case you specifiy any command after image like pwd or ls, it will run this command-->run-->finish-->re-run
 means pod will keep ruuning and crashing.So in case we want to run any command indstead of kind: Pod , we specifiy kind: job

***************************

comand to create pods:
kubectl create 0f sample.yml

# to check the pods
kubectl get pods

# to check the logs
 kubectl logs sample
 
# to view live/running status
watch kubectl get pods

***************************
if we want something to run continously than we create pod
if we want something to run short time than we create service/job

if you specific a command/service to run e.g kind:pod than kubernete will try to run command again and again even if it exectuted.
so we can define it as kind:service


apiversiom:batch/v1
kind:job
metadata:
  name:mypod
spec:
 templete"
   spec:
     containers:
        name:
        image:
        cmd:["ls" "pwd"]
   restartpolicy: never

# to check the job
kubectl get job

To update
kubectl apply if sample.yml
